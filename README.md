1) Add License file ( Change the abve tag depending upon the license we select)
2) Info about paper, add a gif
3) Citation links 
4) Info about the dataset 
5) How to download dataset
6) Hot to run models.

## Introduction
Need and application (cite the two papers published by the guys).

## Information on Abdominal Skin Dataset
Summary on the paper's abdominal section (gender, skin color).

## Downloading Abdominal Skin Dataset
(Give link containing all datasets together, and one with abdominal dataset only).

## Dependencies
Jupyter notebook, python 2(?), tenser flow, keras, opencv.

## Running the Codes
### Mask-RCNN
### U-Net
Summarize the comments in the code.
### Fully Connected Network
Again summarize the code.
### Thresholding
Clean up the MATLAB codes.

## Running the Models
